# News Aggregator

This program aggregates the news from https://www.ynetnews.com/category/3089, the breaking news section.

I have created a database in SQL that saves user data, email, and news preferences.

The program scans the articles to find the words from 4 topics: Sports, Politics, Finance, Weather, and process the most seven used words, excluding stopwords. The common words are saved in a histogram figure.
